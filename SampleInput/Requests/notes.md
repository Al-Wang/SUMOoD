Notes on request files
----------------------

Note files corresponding to three seeds have been included as examples.

Scenario 1a: all requests are for distance 1000m (i.e., one link).

Scenario 1b: all requests have randomly chosen start and end nodes (i.e., all
different distances).

Scenario 1c: all requests have randomly chosen start and end point (i.e., not
necessarily at nodes).

Scenario 2: all requests have randomly chosen start and end nodes (i.e., all
different distances), however all trips start within the residential area in
the southwest of the world, and all trips end at a major node.
